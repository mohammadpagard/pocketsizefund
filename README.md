Accountability for these goals is enforced by:  

1. **Publishing performance** on a regular, automated basis

### Process

Our process is:

create -> launch
   ^         |
   |         v
learn  <-  measure
```

We want to rapidly iterate our research-first mindset by constantly launching with an MVP implementations for every initiative.  

### Principles
